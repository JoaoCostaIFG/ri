# FEUP RI 2022/23

This repository includes the projects my group developed, some materials to
study for the exams, and the theoretical classes' slides.

## Project

### 1st Project

For the first project, we developed a reactive controller for a wall-following
robot. The robot started by wandering randomly until finding a wall. Afterwards,
it would follow the wall, trying to keep a constant distance from it, until
finding the stop point. The map was shaped like a
[Ã‡ (c-cedilla)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87) and the robot had to stop
at the bottom of the cedilla. For this, the robot used a LiDAR.

**Grade:** TBD.
